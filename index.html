									<h2><a href="#">VIDEO GAME<br />
									PROGRAMMER</a></h2>
									<p>As a mature university student, I have developed expertise in programming games using the latest game software. While studying in university for my bachelorâ€™s in computer science, I also undertook a one-year placement as a Junior Software Engineer, to get industry experience working for Northrop Grumman where I excelled in using C# .NET, JavaScript, and MySQL. Seeking a full-time job opportunity to further develop expertise and positively contribute to the success of a professional organization.<br /></p>

									<p>Gameplay Trailer of Exon Laboratories, a single player 3D horror and puzzle based game. You find a way out the 3 levels and are faced with monsters and puzzles needed to solve to beat the game.

										The game was a group project and was all programmed in C++ using Unreal Engine 5. My main tasks were to program the three AI monsters in game along with adding level transitions, sounds and animations to the game.</p>

									<p>Gameplay demo of Desert Safari, a single player 3D arcade checkpoint/lap based racing game. You race against an AI bot and are stranded in a deserted area in Dubai. The game features realistic vehicle physics and I was highly inspired by the Vehicle mechanics from GTA games.

										The whole game was a solo project and was all programmed in C++ using Unreal Engine 4.25.4.
										
										I would also like to make future improvements to the game, making the AI more smarter and setup a split screen local multiplayer with controller support.</p>

									<p>Gameplay demo of Shooting Range Simulation, a single player 3D first-person shooter. This simulation was designed for the purpose of testing one's shooting skills during covid so that our soldiers are upto mark with their shooting skills and can practice from home.

										The whole game was a solo project and was all programmed in C++ using Unreal Engine 5.
										
										I would also like to make future improvements to the game, by adding VR support to the game and make the experience to the simulation completely different.</p>

									<p>Gameplay demo of Fallen Angel, a 2D bullet hell side shooter featuring unique selling points such as 13 different enemies, a tri-stage boss, 5 handcrafted environments and ripping retro music which was all made in a 5 day Game Jam.

										The project was made using Gamemaker 2D and the programming language used in the Game Engine.

										I worked on the character shooting, movement and melee programming along with the camera movement and camera shake.</p>
